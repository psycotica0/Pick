Pick.

Takes in a bunch of lines of input and randomly picks one to put to output.

Mostly I just got tired of making a new "Random _____ Generator" script every time.

Now I can do:
echo -e "Pizza\nChips\nBurger\nStarve" | pick

And it'll tell me what my dinner plans are!
Bonus!

Also good for choosing which episode of a show, or a movies, to watch, perhaps without me even knowing which episode it is:
find SomeShow/ | pick | xargs open

Yes!
Great!

Also, if you're planning on choosing more than one thing you can tell pick to give you more than one.

find SomeShow/ | pick 5 
will give you 5 episodes of SomeShow.

This is better than, and more random than, running pick on the output of find 5 times.


THINGS TO KNOW:
Pick doesn't distinguish between duplicates.
If you ask pick for two items, they could both be the same.
This does, however, allow you to ask it for more items than you give it.
You could pick 100 numbers between 1 and 10, for example.

Also, the default way that Pick is compiled it uses the current number of seconds as a seed value.
This means that if pick is run on the same input more than once per second, you will get the same output every time.
This is not the case if you ask pick for more than one item and only run it once, though.
So, if you want 100 numbers between 1 and 10, it's better to run `seq 1 100 | pick 100` than to run `seq 1 100 | pick` 100 times.
If you run it 100 times, chances are you're going to get the same number 100 times.

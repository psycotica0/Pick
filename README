Pick.

Takes in a bunch of lines of input and randomly picks one to put to output.

Mostly I just got tired of making a new "Random _____ Generator" script every time.

Now I can do:
echo -e "Pizza\nChips\nBurger\nStarve" | pick

And it'll tell me what my dinner plans are!
Bonus!

Also good for choosing which episode of a show, or a movies, to watch, perhaps without me even knowing which episode it is:
find SomeShow/ | pick | xargs open

Yes!
Great!
